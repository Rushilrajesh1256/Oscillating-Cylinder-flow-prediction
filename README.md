## Oscillating-Cylinder-flow-prediction-Lattice-Boltzmann-method
In this numerical study laminar flow over a transversely oscillating cylinder is analysed and its corresponding von karman vortex shedding phenomenon is analysed for various oscillating frequencies.Viscous flows undergo vortex shedding which generally occurs due to lateral flow separation resulting in an oscillatory vortex shedding pattern.
The simulation was run on four hundred thousand elements and 1600x400 mesh resolution at 100 Reynold's number and an oscillating frequency of 2x(the von Karmen Shreading frequency).
The second program runs the collision and the streaming process on multiple course reducing computation time by a measure 13%.
